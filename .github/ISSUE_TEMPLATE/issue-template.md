The Issue: \<Explain the issue and the steps to reproduce it\>

Origin: \<Where you got the mod from\>

Logs(Crash or otherwise): \<[Gist](http://gist.github.com)/[Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) Link(s)\>

**Note on Logs:** Crash logs are not gone once you close the window, they are recorded as text files in the `crash reports` folder, which is found alongside the `mods` and `config` folders. For non-crashing issues, you can provide the `latest.log` file found in the `logs` folder, note that `latest.log` *is* replaced every time you launch the game, unless you prefer sorting through the other log files.

**Note on Origin:** [This](http://stopmodreposts.org/) is why we ask.
